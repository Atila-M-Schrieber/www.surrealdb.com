	<h2><Devicon @size="50" @type="rust" /> Embedding in Rust</h2>
	<p>SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the <Link @link="docs.introduction.architecture">separation of the storage and compute</Link> layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within a number of different language environments. In Rust, SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using a file-based storage engine. The documentation for embedding SurrealDB within Rust has not yet been released. In the meantime, please refer to the <Link @link="docs.integration.sdks.rust">Rust</Link> client SDK documentation to get started with connecting to SurrealDB from Rust.</p>
